# FriendBlend

FriendBlend is an method to perform intelligent image composition, enabling two people to combine two photos of them with the same background into a single one, as if both people were present in the scene together.

This project was built as part of the Digital Image Processing Course at IIIT Hyderabad.

## How to run?
We assume that you will be running this on a linux system which has the GNU standard C Library (most of the normal machines have this).

### Prerequisites
 - `python3.8`
 - `pip` (corresponding to `python3.8`)  
OR  
 - `docker`

### The normal way
Since you most probably don't want to mess up your system's python installation, it's best if you create a python virtual environment.

```sh
project-appy-fizz$ pip install -U virtualenv
project-appy-fizz$ virtualenv venv -p python3.8
project-appy-fizz$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements
```sh
project-appy-fizz$ pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

Now, go inside the `src` directory.
```sh
project-appy-fizz$ cd src
```

Here, source the `.env` file which sets the environment variable `$PYTHONPATH`
```sh
project-appy-fizz/src$ source .env
```

Now, run `main.py` **from inside the same directory**
```sh
project-appy-fizz/src$ python friendblend/main.py
```
This runs it with the default fallback images. If you want to run this on your own images, please put them inside the `images` directory and

```sh
project-appy-fizz/src$ python friendblend/main.py F1.ext F2.ext
```
where files `F1.ext` and `F2.ext` are present in the `images` directory inside our repository.

**NOTE** `F1.ext` is just an example, naming `myfile.png` also works.

### The docker way
If you have docker installed, it's very easy to run our code.

Ensure you are at repository root.

To build the docker image,
```sh
project-appy-fizz$ make build
```

To run the docker image,
```sh
project-appy-fizz$ make run
```

Note that in order to run it with custom images, you'll have to run the actual `docker run` command instead of using the `Makefile`.

```sh
project-appy-fizz$ docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}/images:/images friendblend F1.ext F2.ext
```

where files `F1.ext` and `F2.ext` images are present in the `images` directory inside our repository.

The outputs of each intermediate step of the friendblend algorithm, along with the final output, are stored in `images/outputs/` directory.
